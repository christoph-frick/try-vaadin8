============
Try Vaadin 8
============

This is just a playing ground to fool around with the new mechanics of Vaadin v8.

This is not about beautiful code or best practises, but throwing everything at
it, that edgy, tricky, strange, ... in v7.

There only is one huge source file, with everything thrown in

  src/main/groovy/app/ui/AppUI.groovy

For project setup see https://github.com/christoph-frick/springboot-groovy-vaadin-starter
